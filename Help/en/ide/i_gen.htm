<b>Portable Usage</b>
<br/>
<i>since 3.0</i>
<br/>

<p>To use the IDE as portable, install MP 3.x in a pen-drive or other removable device, and after that create a file called 'portable' in the installation directory. That's all, MP 3.x will store its settings in that directory.<br/>
<br/>
<i>NOTE: when preparing a MP portable installation, you should copy manually any additional files (such as Skins, Demos, Styles, etc) from the MP's Public Documents directory (in XP and alike is usually C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\MIDletPascal; in Vista and alike is usually C:\Users\Public\Documents\MIDletPascal) to the MP installation directory being respecful with the directory structure (that means, the Skins should go in the Skins subdirectory, and so on).</i></p>

<b>WINE Compatibility</b>
<br/>
<i>since 3.0</i>
<br/>

<p>You can use MP 3.x smoothly in Linux by running it with WINE. Be sure to have it installed before trying to install MP 3.x in your system. Read the instructions in the <a href="http://winehq.com/">WINE headquarters</a>.<br/>
<br/>
<i>NOTE: under WINE, MP 3.x will work as portable automatically (this is to ensure it will work well, even under old versions of WINE).</i></p>
