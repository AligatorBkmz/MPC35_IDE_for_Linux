<p>As an approach to address more-than-hobbyst-concerns, Javier Santo Domingo (j-a-s-d) started coding the 3.0 IDE in the end of October 2009, and set the following goals for the 3.0 version:<br/>
<ul>
<li>robust and stable IDE</li>
<li>project group management</li>
<li>automated building enabled environment (cli tools)</li>
<li>full support for conditional defines and source code preprocessing</li>
<li>hexadecimal editing for resources</li>
<li>multiple language support</li>
<li>WINE compatible (for usage in Linux and MacOS)</li>
<li>portable (for usage in pen-drives and other devices)</li>
</ul>
amongst many others which are common requirements in the professional and corporative usage of a development tool.</p>

<p>The main development tool of choice was Turbo Delphi 2006 since its a pascal variant that the community knows very well, its free and provides access to a wide range of third party tools.</p>

<p>For the CLI tools the selected was the Free Pascal compiler (version 2.4.0).</p>

<p>As extra goals were set:
<ul>
<li>some compiler (c-language) tasks already covered in the <a href="../compiler/c_intro.htm">compiler's Introduction</a></li>
<li>remove AV false alarms mainly occurring with the FW.class stub (java-language)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The brand new 3.0 IDE was built from scratch and does not contain any line of the old one (was not pascal written and also contained usage of commercial third party controls).</p>
